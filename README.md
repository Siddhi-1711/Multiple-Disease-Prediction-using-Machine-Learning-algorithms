# Disease Prediction Projects

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting heart disease, diabetes, and cancer using three different algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF).

## Overview

Each disease-specific project is contained within its own directory, including datasets, trained models, and performance evaluation results.
